**Welcome** to the mini-course Productivity and Learning for Engineers. This course is designed to take **about 5-7 hours** in total, including both lessons and assignments/independent work. All materials for this course can be found **in this repository**, with additional materials for reference and enrichment linked for your perusal. Since this course draws inspiration from multiple other sources, it is recommended to check those sources as well if you feel so inclined.

This course is primarily aimed at **high school and college students studying engineering**, and the content of this course is designed with this group in mind; however, **others can benefit** from the lessons and exercises here.


**In this course, you will learn:**

- How to most effectively make changes, big and small, to your *habits and routines*;
- When and when not to use *productivity systems* like goals, and how to make these systems work for you;
- The best methods for *learning, reviewing, and remembering* things in the long term;
- Tricks for finding and practicing *valued skills* in your field;
- Methods for independently taking yourself past these lessons and *to the real world*;

And much more knowledge that will hopefully come in handy for your studies, career, and daily life.

**The course is divided into eight main lessons**, each of which contains the following content:

- *Reading:* the actual text and core of each lesson. Students should, at minimum, do the reading for each lesson; the other content, although recommended, is not strictly necessary and is designed to reinforce the concepts in the reading.
- *Enrichment Materials:* reference materials that the reading may be based on, inspired by, or related to. Students interested in a more in-depth review of the lesson topic may elect to go through these sources.
- *Lesson Applications:* recommended ways to implement the concepts covered in the lesson. This course is by nature most effective when applied to daily life. Students should strive to at least try one application per lesson.
- *Independent Exploration:* optional ways students can learn more on their own.
- *Learning Aids:* materials prepared to help students review and remember content, like flashcards (see Lesson 1 for why you should be interested in these!)

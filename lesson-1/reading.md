### Welcome!

Hello! I'm honored that you've decided to take this course.
Whether you are an engineering student or not, I have no doubt that at least some of the material you will learn in this course will be helpful to you.
I hope that you can come away from this course having learned the most important things you need to be successful in your studies and career!

This course is divided into eight main lessons, each of which contains the following content:

- Reading: the actual text and core of each lesson. You should, at minimum, do the reading for each lesson; the other content, although recommended, is not strictly necessary and is designed to reinforce the concepts in the reading.
- Enrichment Materials: reference materials that the reading may be based on, inspired by, or related to. If you're interested in a more in-depth review of the lesson topic, you may elect to go through these sources.
- Lesson Applications: recommended ways to implement the concepts covered in the lesson. This course is by nature most effective when applied to daily life. You may want to at least try one application per lesson.
- Independent Exploration: optional ways you can learn more on your own.
- Tools: materials prepared to help you review and remember content, like flashcards (read on for why you should be interested in these!)

I believe that working through these extra materials (at minimum, the lesson applications and tools) are equally as critical to your success as the main lesson itself.
This course is designed to be applied to your own studies and career, and the opportunities provided in this lesson are the most convenient way to do that.

Again, I hope this course helps you on your path to success! Without further ado, let's begin.

### Summer Slide

Have you ever taken a calculus class? One of the core concepts you probably learned in that class was the quotient rule, for taking derivatives of functions being divided.
If your experience was anything like mine, you probably did a billion problems in class to practice that concept.
So you should probably be able to answer, what is the quotient rule definition?

Yeah, you probably don't remember (unless you're taking calculus right now, of course!), since the last time you used it was long ago enough for you to forget it even exists.
We have these experiences all the time in school - we spend a lot of time learning something in class, then once that class is over, we've forgotten almost everything by the next year.

This specific type of forgetting is actually a widespread phenomenon in students, called "summer learning loss" or "summer slide".
In the USA, we lose on average one month of learning over the summer (all sources at the end of this reading) - and this number is higher for older students than younger ones, which means we tend to lose almost half a semester's worth of knowledge.
This is something we especially want to avoid in college, where our classes are usually a semester long, and can be very important for future classes!

So why does forgetting work this way? Why is it that we can spend a semester or even a year stuffing something into our brains, only to have it fall out after a month?
And how much learning do we need to do to prevent ourselves from forgetting stuff? To answer that, let's look at a little bit of psychology!

### The Forgetting Curve and Spaced Repetition

Back in the late 1800s, the German psychologist Hermann Ebbinghaus conducted an experiment on himself by memorizing thousands of nonsense syllables and seeing how many he remembered over time. These results, when graphed, created what is called the "forgetting curve", which shows approximately exponential decay - in other words, as time passes you forget stuff.

This is intuitive if somewhat underwhelming, but it's also the foundational idea for Ebbinghaus's hypothesized methods for remembering. Among other interesting conclusions (which we will cover later in this course), Ebbinghaus identified two main methods for consistently increasing strength of memory:

1. Easier representation (like mnemonics)
2. Active, spaced repetition

The first of these methods merits its own discussion, and will get one later in this course, but we will focus on the second method here. At first glance, it might seem like another incredibly obvious statement - review something to remember it - but here, the details are what make the technique work.

Spaced repetition is the act of reviewing something at "spaced" intervals, which, if done right, lessens the decay of the forgetting curve. The optimal spacing, it turns out, is in increasing intervals; initially, you should review information very soon to when you first learn it (University of Waterloo recommends "within 24 hours"; Anki, a popular memory program (more later!) generally starts with an interval of 1-5 days), but as you progress, you may need to only review once a month, once a year, or even less than that to keep the information stable in your memory!

You should make sure to constantly review: continually practicing information will signal to your brain that remembering it is important, but neglecting review will tell your brain it's OK to forget it.
This is how summer slide works - during the school year, your brain hangs on to the information it needs to pass quizzes and tests, but during summer, the information is no longer necessary and is forgotten.

There are many ways to practice with spaced repetition nowadays, and we will be going over one of the most convenient and popular ways to do so. First, though, let's answer a question you might be asking: Isn't rote memorization a bad way to learn? Why are we optimizing for memorization instead of, say, understanding?

### Why Memorize?

Increasingly, modern learning methods have shifted away from rote memorization as a tool for comprehension. Tests are open-note, open-book, or have formula sheets provided; homework is designed to be used with reference tables for constants and equations; and memorizing times tables is associated mostly with dusty antebellum-era classrooms with armies of neatly-dressed students chanting, "Two times two makes four, two times three makes six..."

To clarify, I am not advocating for the return of rote memory as the *core* of learning (I rely far too much on formula sheets to do so). Having these resources is beneficial, and allows us to free up effort from memorizing dreary lists of numbers to instead use it on conceptual understanding. In a similar vein, though, our memorization of large bases of knowledge provide a solid foundation for us to focus on what we want to learn, instead of constantly having to go back and review old content. Imagine learning a new language, for example; before you can start practicing and applying new grammar structures, you have to have a large amount of words memorized to use for practice. If you had to look up the translation of each individual word every time, you'd never make any progress on the complex stuff because you'd be too caught up in minutiae you could easily have offloaded to your memory.

Of course, memory plays a much more practical role in our success by helping us remember class material for assessments. Not having to relearn content each cram session before a test frees up a significant fraction of our time to use for something more productive (or fun) than deciphering old notes.

Now that we've looked at the overall reasoning for making memorization a part of our learning, let's learn how we can apply this to our study routines and lives in general.

### Introduction to Anki

In this course, we will focus on Anki as our main tool for memorization. Anki is, in essence, a flashcard application (available on most major platforms), which integrates the idea of spaced repetition into its reviewing structure. While there are multiple ways to review using spaced repetition (an example being the Leitner Box, a physical flashcard sorter and scheduler - look it up if you like using physical flashcards!), Anki is one of the easiest to use, automatically scheduling reviews with optimal timing. The app is also free and open source (although the main app for mobile costs a little money, the web version is free and works fine on mobile if you also have the free computer app), and has a delightfully clean interface, compared to some ad-infested flashcard websites I could name. The download links are available at **https://apps.ankiweb.net/**

The core of Anki is the deck, a collection of flashcards which you can make yourself or import. Anki is especially popular among language learners and medical students, so many premade decks exist for those subjects in particular. However, I recommend making your own cards in most cases (I will describe why later in this reading).

If you'd like to follow along for this section, it is highly recommended to do so on a computer. First, download Anki using the above link, then open it. You should see a button saying "Create Deck" at the bottom of the main window; press it and type in a name like "Test Deck". You should see the deck appear in the main window, with stats to the right indicating 0 new cards, 0 learning cards, 0 due cards.

New cards are cards you haven't looked at yet, learning cards are ones you're repeatedly reviewing in a short span of time, and due cards are cards scheduled for review based on the spaced repetition algorithm. Let's add some cards to see how this works: click the Add tab at the top.

You will see two fields labeled "Front" and "Back". These work like standard flashcards, where you see the front side then try to remember the back side. In the top right corner, you should be able to choose your test deck by clicking on the Deck button. Type "What is 1 + 1?" in the "Front" field, and "2" in the "Back" field, then click the "Add" button in the bottom left to add the card to your deck. Now click "close" in the bottom right to go back to the main window, and you'll see that "Test Deck" now has 1 card listed under New. Anki gives you a handful of new cards every day (you can configure that amount) for each deck until you've done the maximum amount that day or you've looked at every card in the deck.

Click on the deck name to open the review screen. When you open the card, you'll see "What is 1 + 1?" at the top, with the "Show Answer" button at the bottom. Try to remember the answer to the question, then press "Show Answer" when you're ready. (Note: if you're reviewing and don't remember, don't immediately show the answer, spend some time thinking. This helps your brain to focus on the information and remember it better for next time.)

You will see four buttons: Again, Hard, Good, and Easy, which rate how well you remembered the item on the card. The number above them shows the interval Anki will give until you next review the card (intervals of minutes/hours put the card in "Learning" status, while intervals of days move the card to the "Due" field on that day). Anki sorts cards with a metric called "ease", which accumulates with each successful review and is reset when you press "Again", to space the intervals with increasing time. Press any of the buttons to successfully review that card.

This course includes an Anki deck focusing on the key points of each lesson

*This reading makes up the main core of this lesson. Students are advised to complete the reading before working through other lesson materials.*

### Welcome!

Hello! I'm honored that you've decided to take this course.
Whether you are an engineering student or not, I have no doubt that at least some of the material you will learn in this course will be helpful to you.
I hope that you can come away from this course having learned the most important things you need to be successful in your studies and career!

This course is divided into eight main lessons, each of which contains the following content:

- Reading: the actual text and core of each lesson. You should, at minimum, do the reading for each lesson; the other content, although recommended, is not strictly necessary and is designed to reinforce the concepts in the reading.
- Enrichment Materials: reference materials that the reading may be based on, inspired by, or related to. If you're interested in a more in-depth review of the lesson topic, you may elect to go through these sources.
- Lesson Applications: recommended ways to implement the concepts covered in the lesson. This course is by nature most effective when applied to daily life. You may want to at least try one application per lesson.
- Independent Exploration: optional ways you can learn more on your own.
- Tools: materials prepared to help you review and remember content, like flashcards (read on for why you should be interested in these!)

I believe that working through these extra materials (at minimum, the lesson applications and tools) are equally as critical to your success as the main lesson itself.
This course is designed to be applied to your own studies and career, and the opportunities provided in this lesson are the most convenient way to do that.

Again, I hope this course helps you on your path to success! Without further ado, let's begin.

**WIP. format in an actual way once done; lesson outline:**

### Summer Slide

Have you ever taken a calculus class? One of the core concepts you probably learned in that class was the quotient rule, for taking derivatives of functions being divided.
If your experience was anything like mine, you probably did a billion problems in class to practice that concept.
So you should probably be able to answer, what is the quotient rule definition?

Yeah, you probably don't remember (unless you're taking calculus right now, of course!), since the last time you used it was long ago enough for you to forget it even exists.
We have these experiences all the time in school - we spend a lot of time learning something in class, then once that class is over, we've forgotten almost everything by the next year.

This specific type of forgetting is actually a widespread phenomenon in students, called "summer learning loss" or "summer slide".
In the USA, we lose on average one month of learning over the summer (all sources at the end of this reading) - and this number is higher for older students than younger ones, which means we tend to lose almost half a semester's worth of knowledge.
This is something we especially want to avoid in college, where our classes are usually a semester long, and can be very important for future classes!

So why does forgetting work this way? Why is it that we can spend a semester or even a year stuffing something into our brains, only to have it fall out after a month?
And how much learning do we need to do to prevent ourselves from forgetting stuff? To answer that, let's look at a little bit of psychology!

### The Forgetting Curve and Spaced Repetition

Back in the late 1800s, the German psychologist Hermann Ebbinghaus conducted an experiment on himself by memorizing thousands of nonsense syllables and seeing how many he remembered over time. These results, when graphed, created what is called the "forgetting curve", which shows approximately exponential decay - in other words, as time passes you forget stuff.

This is intuitive if somewhat underwhelming, but it's also the foundational idea for Ebbinghaus's hypothesized methods for remembering. Among other interesting conclusions (which we will cover later in this course), Ebbinghaus identified two main methods for consistently increasing strength of memory:

1. Easier representation (like mnemonics)
2. Active, spaced repetition

The first of these methods merits its own discussion, and will get one later in this course, but we will focus on the second method here. At first glance, it might seem like another incredibly obvious statement - review something to remember it - but here, the details are what make the technique work.

Spaced repetition is the act of reviewing something at "spaced" intervals, which, if done right, lessens the decay of the forgetting curve. The optimal spacing, it turns out, is in increasing intervals; initially, you should review information very soon to when you first learn it (University of Waterloo recommends "within 24 hours"; Anki, a popular memory program (more later!) generally starts with an interval of 1-5 days), but as you progress, you may need to only review once a month, once a year, or even less than that to keep the information stable in your memory!

You should make sure to constantly review: continually practicing information will signal to your brain that remembering it is important, but neglecting review will tell your brain it's OK to forget it.
This is how summer slide works - during the school year, your brain hangs on to the information it needs to pass quizzes and tests, but during summer, the information is no longer necessary and is forgotten.

There are many ways to practice with spaced repetition nowadays, and we will be going over one of the most convenient and popular ways to do so. First, though, let's answer a question you might be asking: Isn't rote memorization a bad way to learn? Why are we optimizing for memorization instead of, say, understanding?

### Why Memorize?

Increasingly, modern learning methods have shifted away from rote memorization as a tool for comprehension. Tests are open-note, open-book, or have formula sheets provided; homework is designed to be used with reference tables for constants and equations; and memorizing times tables is associated mostly with dusty antebellum-era classrooms with armies of neatly-dressed students chanting, "Two times two makes four, two times three makes six..."

To clarify, I am not advocating for the return of rote memory as the *core* of learning (I rely too much on formula sheets to do so). Having these resources is beneficial, and allows us to free up effort from memorizing dreary lists of numbers to instead use it on conceptual understanding.

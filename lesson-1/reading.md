### Welcome!

Hello! I'm honored that you've decided to take this course.
Whether you are an engineering student or not, I have no doubt that at least some of the material you will learn in this course will be helpful to you.
I hope that you can come away from this course having learned the most important things you need to be successful in your studies and career!

This course is divided into eight main lessons, each of which contains the following content:

- Reading: the actual text and core of each lesson. You should, at minimum, do the reading for each lesson; the other content, although recommended, is not strictly necessary and is designed to reinforce the concepts in the reading.
- Enrichment Materials: reference materials that the reading may be based on, inspired by, or related to. If you're interested in a more in-depth review of the lesson topic, you may elect to go through these sources.
- Lesson Applications: recommended ways to implement the concepts covered in the lesson. This course is by nature most effective when applied to daily life. You may want to at least try one application per lesson.
- Independent Exploration: optional ways you can learn more on your own.
- Tools: materials prepared to help you review and remember content, like flashcards (read on for why you should be interested in these!)

I believe that working through these extra materials (at minimum, the lesson applications and tools) are equally as critical to your success as the main lesson itself.
This course is designed to be applied to your own studies and career, and the opportunities provided in this lesson are the most convenient way to do that.

Again, I hope this course helps you on your path to success! Without further ado, let's begin.

**WIP. format in an actual way once done; lesson outline:**
- idk intro
- the forgetting curve and spaced repetition
- why memorize stuff?
- Anki & quick anki primer/tutorial
- How to make good anki cards and avoid bad anki cards
- Make your own decks or not? When to make decks and what to make decks for?
- Never miss twice; 5 cards a day is better than none; taking breaks and recovering from inactivity
- questions/further materials

### Summer Slide

Have you ever taken a calculus class? One of the core concepts you probably learned in that class was the quotient rule, for taking derivatives of functions being divided.
If your experience was anything like mine, you probably did a billion problems in class to practice that concept.
So you should probably be able to answer, what is the quotient rule definition?

Yeah, you probably don't remember (unless you're taking calculus right now, of course!), since the last time you used it was long ago enough for you to forget it even exists.
We have these experiences all the time in school - we spend a lot of time learning something in class, then once that class is over, we've forgotten almost everything by the next year.

This specific type of forgetting is actually a widespread phenomenon in students, called "summer learning loss" or "summer slide".
In the USA, we lose on average one month of learning over the summer (all sources at the end of this reading) - and this number is higher for older students than younger ones, which means we tend to lose almost half a semester's worth of knowledge.
This is something we especially want to avoid in college, where our classes are usually a semester long, and can be very important for future classes!

So why does forgetting work this way? Why is it that we can spend a semester or even a year stuffing something into our brains, only to have it fall out after a month?
And how much learning do we need to do to prevent ourselves from forgetting stuff? To answer that, let's look at a little bit of psychology!
